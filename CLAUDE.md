# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a content repository containing curated learning resources—not a software project. It consists of markdown files organizing recommendations for books, articles, podcasts, videos, and (planned) papers.

## Structure

- `Curated Learning.md` - Main index with category links and status table
- `Books.md` - Book recommendations organized by domain
- `Articles.md` - Curated articles with highlight counts
- `Podcasts.md` - Podcast episodes with highlight counts
- `Videos.md` - Conference talks and presentations

## Content Format

Resources follow this pattern:
- **[Title](URL)** - Author/Source. Brief description. (N highlights) - for articles/podcasts
- **[Title](URL)** - Author. Description. - for books/videos

## When Editing

- Maintain consistent markdown formatting across files
- Include the highlight count in parentheses for articles and podcasts
- Update the status table in `Curated Learning.md` when adding resources
- Use Obsidian-style wiki links (`[[Category]]`) for internal navigation
